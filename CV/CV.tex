\begin{rSection}{Profile}
I currently work as a research assistant for Prof. Jin Huang in Physics\&Geometry group, State Key Lab of CAD\&CG, Zhejiang University. My research interest is mainly on physics-based simulation by numerical PDE solving and using numerical optimization for visual computing problems. I have some experience in solid and fluid simulation, geometry processing and deep learning.
