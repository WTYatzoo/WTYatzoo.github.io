\begin{rSection}{Profile}
I currently work as a research assistant for Prof. Jin Huang in Physics\&Geometry group, State Key Lab of CAD\&CG, Zhejiang University. My research interest is mainly on physics-based forward simulation by numerical PDE solving and using numerical optimization for inverse physical or geometric design. I have some experience in solid(FEM based elasticity, mass-spring model , discrete rod model , discrete shell model, subspace acceleration) and fluid (SPH, grid, hybrid method, SWE model) simulation, geometry processing (smoothing, fairing, basic parameterization, geometric energy based deformation, subdivision, geodesic distance computation) and deep learning (CNN, GAN, super-resolution, style transfer)

\begin{rSection}{Selected Graphics related Projects}

  {\bf Cloth or solid simulation using mass-spring model}\\Implement three versions of mass-spring based simulation: using classical Newton method, using local-global strategy based on the paper \textit{Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems}, using modified fast mass-spring based on the paper \textit{A Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Approach for Accelerating Projective and Position-based Dynamics} with a CUDA version jacobi solver acceleration.\\
  \\{\bf Numerical coarsening of FEM based solid simulation}\\ Research for numerical coarsening acceleration solving of FEM based solid simulation of heterogeneous materials with non-linear constitutive laws with coarse grid. See the paper \emph{Numerical Coarsening using Discontinuous Shape Functions} for the algorithm details. In this process, I implemented a basic FEM based solid simulation framework quickly first and then did the major two papers' comparison experiments almost by myself. And the first author Jiong Chen and I frequently communicated to analyze the experiment results. \\
  \\{\bf Heat flow based geodesic distance computation}\\An implementation of the paper \emph{Geodesics in Heat:A New Approach to Computing Distance Based on Heat Flow} which uses heat flow to compute the geodesic distance for per mesh vertex or per points cloud's point to the specified mesh vertex or point on point cloud. The algorithm core is just solving a Possion equation which is elegant and concise in maths!\\
  \\{\bf L1-based construction of polycube maps for mesh}\\ An implementation of the core algorithm of the paper \emph{L1-based Construction of Polycube Maps from Complex Shapes} which uses a L1 Polycube deformation based method for hexahedralization and the algorithm is mainly solving L1 norm optimization problem.\\
    \\{\bf Super-resolution of shallow water equation simulation based on GAN}\\ Research for SWE simulation data's super-resolution using GAN. See the \emph{\href{https://wtyatzoo.github.io/reports/SWE.pdf}{report}} for details. \\
